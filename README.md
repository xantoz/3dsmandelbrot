#3dsmandelbrot 

No homebrew scene is complete without a gazillion mandelbrot zoomers, so here is another one.

zoom in by selecting an area on the touchscreen and lifting the pen (currently missing a useful indicator, so please imagine a red rectangle or something 
similar)
Press A to reset zoom to standard level.
Press B to cycle between nice colors mode, silly 3d mode and regular old B/W mode.
Press START to quit
